Math skills are made more comprehensible by coding.Coding can help you improve your logical thinking skills by allowing you to see problems from a new perspective. Complex coding projects are made up of smaller tasks and by breaking down the problem and adopting a methodological way of thinking, you can tackle any challenge.Coding allows humans to communicate with these devices. Modern technology such as traffic lights, calculators, smart TVs, and cars use internal coding systems. Since computers do not communicate like humans, coding acts as a translator. Code converts human input into numerical sequences that computers understand.

The recent protest in downtown Austin, where a large group of citizens gathered to voice their concerns about proposed changes to the city's zoning laws, directly relates to the concept of "collective action" we've discussed in class. By coming together in a public demonstration, residents were attempting to exert influence on policy decisions that could significantly impact their community, demonstrating the power of unified action to address shared interests and potentially affect political outcomes, a key aspect of collective behavior study. This event highlights the potential for citizen engagement when individuals feel strongly about an issue and choose to mobilize as a group to advocate for change.On April 24 and 29, dozens of people gathered on the UT Austin campus to protest Israel's war in Gaza. Before the first protest, administrators told the Palestine Solidarity Committee, the student-led group organizing it, they were not authorized to hold the demonstration and could face consequences if they did.

Reflecting on last Friday's class with the substitute teacher, it's clear that our behavior could have been significantly more respectful and cooperative, making their job considerably harder than it needed to be. Frequent disruptions, lack of focus, and not following instructions likely left the substitute feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by the end of the day. If we could go back, the most important change would be to actively listen, follow directions promptly, and demonstrate a genuine effort to engage with the lesson, minimizing unnecessary distractions and showing greater consideration for the substitute's role.
To ensure a positive experience for future substitutes, I will personally commit to setting a positive example by actively participating, asking thoughtful questions, and being mindful of my behavior. Additionally, I will actively encourage classmates to show the same level of respect and cooperation, making a concerted effort to create a welcoming and supportive learning environment for any temporary teacher who enters our classroom.

During my spring break, I primarily used technology for entertainment and communication, including streaming services, social media, and video games. These experiences, while enjoyable, also highlighted the importance of responsible technology use and the potential for technology to both facilitate and hinder learning, which connects to our class's focus on technology's impact on education and society.

AI only predicted a few upsets in the first round, like No. 10 Utah State seed beating No. 7 seed UCLA, even as upsets like that are pretty common. In addition, both had several No. 1 seeds advancing to the Final Four.But what truly makes the tournament special is how often we see smaller schools and underdogs make incredible runs, which is what really causes the "madness." These underdogs are often called "Cinderella" teams, with fans trying to pick them out each year ahead of the tournament.Each year—while fans agonize over their brackets—networks, advertisers and sponsors turn college basketball's biggest stage into a high-stakes business arena. From billion-dollar TV deals to the unsung economic boost for host cities, the madness isn't just on the court—it's in the bank accounts, too.
